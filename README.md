# node-basic-server
This code sets up a simple HTTP server using Node.js.
It imports the built-in 'http' module, creates an HTTP server, and listens on a specified port. When a request is received, the server responds with a '200 OK' status code and sends the response 'Bye' to the client.

To run this code: Run the command node server.js.
